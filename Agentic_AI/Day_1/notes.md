### Understanding what are Agents

*   An AI agent is something that takes you from Point A to Point B (by adding value i.e. saving time or money).
*   It has the capabilities like decision making, planning, reasoning, and tool calling.
*   AI Agents interact with the external environment and perform continuous learning via human-in-the-loop feedback.
*   Memory is a key component of an AI agent for improvement and avoiding repetitive mistakes.

### Industry Use Cases of AI Agents: Sales Team Automation Workflow

*   Agent automates prospect discovery, cold emailing, scheduling, call transcription, sentiment analysis, and lead classification.
*   Tools needed: LinkedIn API, Google Sheets, Salesforce, Slack, Zoom, Twilio, etc.
*   Value: Cost reduction, increased outreach, and improved lead conversion.

### Role of Language Model in AI Agents

*   Transformer architecture revolutionized language understanding, enabling advanced LLMs.
*   LLMs act as the brain of Agents, and tools form the body.
*   Agents combine LLM + tools to perform tasks + memory + feedback loop.

### Level of Agency in AI Agents

*   Agency level is the degree of control: from simple tool calling to multi-agent workflows.
*   Higher agency correlates with greater value creation.
